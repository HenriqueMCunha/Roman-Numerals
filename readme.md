# Roman Numerals Converter Project

---
This is my project:
- The current program will take in an arabic numeral as an input from the user and convert it into a Roman Numeral
- Testing file with tests focused around more difficult numbers
- Found out having to supply arrays with number 4, 40, 400 and 4000 as program wouldn't work properly otherwise. Currently working on a solution for it.
